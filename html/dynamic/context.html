			<h1>What is this webiste?</h1>
			<p>Here, you will (hopefully) find all of the answers that you have for why this
			website exists. After reading this, if you still can't fathom why this website exists
			or why it is the way it is, please feel free to <a href="/html/dynamic/professional.html">
				contact me</a> or <a href="https://github.com/agupta231/ankurgupta.info">open up an issue
				on this website's github</a> to express your dissatisfaction.</p>

			<h2>"Oh god, what dark corner of the internet did I stumble upon?"</h2>
			<p>That is what you are probably asking yourself right now. Don't worry! You are just in
			the place where all of my brain's runoff is dumped! Hmm... on second thought, you should
			be <i>very</i> worried.

			<h2>"Alright, I'm shivering in my boots... but what's on this website?"</h2>
			<p>Just like it was mentioned previously... all of my brain's runoff. This could be 
			experiments to optimize my life, cool things I find about a certain programming language, 
			or just me ranting about life. The occasional pun may pop out here or there as well.
			This website isn't catered to a specific demographic, but is rather a running record 
			of the things I do, in case they come in handy later. But why is this written as if
			I'm talking to others? Well, I need practice writing... totally. </p>

			<p>Totally... I'm definetly not talking to the voices in my head... <i>Shut up, Billy!</i></p>

			<h2>"Sure... but why does this website look like shit?"</h2>
			<p>Hey bud, listen up. I've worked as a front-end designer, and if you want to see what
			I can to do make things pretty, feel free to look at my resume (shameless plug - my
			resume is available <a href="/html/dynamic/professional.html">here</a>) Instead of getting into an argument
			about functionality vs. aesthetic (which I'll probably end up writing about anyways), I would
			like to ask you a series of boolean questions:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Is this website easy to read?</li>
				<li>Is this website responsive?</li>
				<li>Is this website lightweight?</li>
				<li>Have I written all of this website in a VIM so old that I'm pretty sure
				it was compiled before I was born?</li>
				<li>Is this entire website (excluding pictures, of course), take up less
				filespace than <a href="http://www.catsvscancer.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Taco-Cat-Spelled-Backwards-Is-Taco-Cat.1.jpg">
					picture of a cat in a taco?</a></li>
				<li>Does it take more time to brush my teeth in the morning than it
				does to maintain this website??</li>
				<li>Does this website work even though my hosting service is like a
				million years old and doesn't have anything past PHP 5?!?! Like, c'mon guys,
				give me some freaking JavaScript!</li>
			</ul>

			<p>At the end of the day, this is just another <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/" />
			website</a> that everybody on the interwebs (including those 2 people in the world
			with IE6) can use easily.</p>

			<p>With that being said, I may end up wanting to do some JavaScript experiemnts in the future.
			So, if you see any fancy animations, search functionality, or some wierd ML business, please
			be 100% certain that it is me trying out something new, <i>not</i> me putting aesthetics before
			functionality.</p>
