      <h2>The Ergodox EZ Saga: Why I want to spend $300 on a keyboard.</h2>
      <p>For context, at the time of writing this post, I am a college student. A broke college 
      student at that. Whenever I see the price for something, I subconsciously calculate the 
      object's worth in ramen. Thus, when I got on the market for a new keyboard, I couldn't have
      imagined spending more than a couple of words on a keyboard. Boy, was I wrong.</p> 
      
      <p>Now, before I go on a huge rant justifying why I spent way too much money on a keyboard, 
      let me tell you why I was on the market for a new keyboard<p>

      <h3>My Sob Story</h3>

      <p>When I was just a little lad learning the ins and outs of a computer, my parents gave me
      an early 2000s Dell Latitude running Fedora Linux to play around with. As I had just gotten a
      new toy to play with, I was perfectly happy living with the crappy laptop keyboard. Through
      the years, my interest in technology grew, but my care for ergonomics did not. Until 8th grade
      or so, I would have perhaps the worst posture known to man. I'm talking about lying down on my
      bed, necked arched up to look at my computer screen, and my hands in who knows what position
      to allow me to type.</p>
      
      <p>Then, in 8th grade, my dad started complaining about having RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury).
      Me being the paranoid little child that I am, got scared and bought the same keyboard
      that my dad ordered for himself: the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.</p>

      <p>I used that for a while, and was happy with it, but didn't really notice too big of a
      change. Then, around junior year of high school, I got sucked into the mechanical keyboard
      craze. I ordered myself a Cherry MX Blue knockoff keyboard from Amazon, and couldn't have been
      happier. The switches were super crisp, and the sounds were to die for. I had fallen in
      love.</p>

      <p>...Then, my wrists started to hurt. After just a few minutes of typing, everything would
      start killing. I knew what was happening to me, and I also knew that I plan to have a very
      long typing career ahead of me. Dragging my heels into the floor, I forced myself to revert
      back to the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for my health's sake. Only one problem: membrane
      keyboards... well, are shit. Now, don't get me wrong, the vast majority of people will be
      happy with their keyboard, and will never bat an eye. However, for those of you who have
      dabbled in the world of mechanical keyboards, you will know what I am talking about. A
      membrane keyboard is just so <i>mushy</i>. It's weird to describe, but I actually threw up a
      little bit in my mouth everything I had  to use the keyboard. The Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard
      4000 had served me well, but it was time for a change.</p>
      
      <h3>What I am looking for in a keyboard</h3>  
      
      <p>Since I am going to get a new keyboard, I might as well get one that is optimized for my
      needs: </p>

      <h4>Custom angling and further arm placement</h4>

       <p>Proper ergonomic posture states that your keyboard should be at a negative incline, and
       that your hands should be a shoulder-width apart. As the primary reason for this keyboard is
       to protect me from the years of typing ahead, these features are absolutely necessary for a
       healthy career.</p>

       <h4>Mechanical</h4>

       <p>Absolutely required. Just look at my experiences above. I can deal with a membrane
       keyboard on a laptop... that I understand. However, I type for 8+ hours a day at my desk, and
       you better believe that I want to enjoy every living second of that.</p>

       <h4>RGB Backlighting</h4>
        
       <p>Am I being a little childish? Yeah... I guess so. I have always been infatuated with the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCce65Q6b2c">RGB reactive typing effect</a>. Having
       your keyboard light up when you are typing... <i>Gah! It's so damn cool!</i>
       
       <h4>Macros/Remappable Keys</h4>

       <p>As I have worked on making my setup more and more mouse-free, I am quickly running into
       the issue of there not being enough keys on my keyboard for my day to day tasks. For example,
       I often run VIM through a tmux instance in my i3 window manager on my Arch Linux machine. As
       I like to keep things consistent to allow for a quicker learning curve, all of my navigation
       is done through the classic <code>h,j,k,l</code> keys. However, for i3, I need to prefix each
       key with <code>meta (Command/Win)</code>. For VIM's pane navigation, I need to prefix each
       key with <code>control</code>. For tmux, I need to prefix each key with either
       <code>alt</code> or <code>control-b</code>. Ouch, my hand hurts from just thinking about
       that. If you would like to check out my setup more, you can always look at my
       <a href="https://github.com/agupta231/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>. I would really love to have the 
       ability to have the same keys correlate to the same functionality in all my programs, and
       have a simple modifier to switch the whole keyboard in to a "VIM mode", or something
       similar.</p>

        <h3>Why the Ergodox EZ</h3>

        <p>Now that I have laid out all of my criteria for my perfect keyboard, let me justify my
        purchase in the Ergodox EZ. As I really don't want to type out redundant bits of info, and
        I'm sure that you don't want to read redundant bits of info, I'm just going to point out the
        highlights.</p>

        <h4>No soldering (A premade package)</h4>

        <p>Don't start hating on me just yet! I love working on projects as the next guy, but I am
        not willing to drop $300 on a keyboard that comes in a million parts from 6 or so sources.
        If it turns out that I don't like the keyboard, could you imagine the hassle of trying to
        return that behemoth? I understand that I will have to pay more for this keyboard, but I at
        least have the ability to get a decent amount of money back if I decide that this keyboard
        doesn't suit me. And given the bizarre shape of this keyboard, there is a very good chance
        of that happening</p> 

        <h4>32 FREAKING LAYERS && Open Source!!!@!@!</h4>

        <p>You read that right... There are 32 programmable layers on this bad larry! I'm already
        imagining the different layouts that I'll whip up. I also think that there is potential in
        creating a keylogger that tracks me working to determine the most efficient layout for my
        keyboard.</p>

        <p>Also, the fact that this whole design is open source is a huge plus. I personally love
        the open-source community, and I can't wait to work with them to optimize another part of my
        life. The ability to program the keyboard with C is also really appealing to me (the fact
        that I can program it, not the language that I program it in... Although that is a
        discussion for another day). Graphical configurators are nice and all, but having the power
        of a Turing-complete language on your <i>keyboard</i> is a whole new level.</p>
        
        <h4>RIP RGB Backlighting</h4>

        <p>Nothing in life is ever perfect, is it? I won't get my fancy ripple effects, but for a
        keyboard that checks off every other requirement, not having a bunch of lights is by far the
        best compromise that I could ask for.</p>

        <h3>Final Remarks</h3>

        <p>I'm really excited to see how this keyboard turns out for me. I honestly believe that
        this keyboard has potential to be a keeper, and I can't wait to try it out and see where it
        takes me!</p>
