      <p>My board just came in today. It is, umm... different. Typing on it is definitely going to
      take some getting used to.  In fact, I am writing this post right now on it. It is painfully
      slow. I think that I am only at 50 wpm at the moment, when I used to average around 80-90
      before. I'll write more about my objective journey on the next post. Right now, I feel like a
      sloth. I'm gonna spend a couple of hours on <a href="typeracer.com">typeracer</a> and 
      <a href="typing.io">typing.io</a> to hopefully get a bit more comfortable on the keyboard.</p>

      <p>Also, the default keyboard layout sucks. I have already created a <a
         href="https://github.com/agupta231/Ergodox-EZ-Setup">repo</a> for the project. Once I can
     type basic QWERTY at a reasonable speed, I'm going to start digging in to customizing the heck
     out this of this keyboard.</p>

      <p>That's gonna be it for now, folks</p>
