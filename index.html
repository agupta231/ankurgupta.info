			<h2>"Oh god, what dark corner of the internet did I stumble upon?"</h2>
			<p>That is what you are probably asking yourself right now. Don't worry! You are just in
			the place where all of my brain's runoff is dumped! Hmm... on second thought, you should
			be <i>very</i> worried.

			<h2>"Alright, I'm shivering in my boots... but what's on this website?"</h2>
			<p>Just like it was mentioned previously... all of my brain's runoff. This could be 
			anything to experiments to optimize my life, cool things I find about a certain
			programming language, or just me ranting about life. The occasional pun may pop out
			here or there as well. This website isn't catered to a specific demographic, but is
			rather a running record of the things I do, in case it come in handy later. But why
			is this written as if I'm talking to others? Well, I need practice writing... totally.
			</p>

			<p>Totally... I'm definetly not talking to the voices in my head... <i>Shut up, Billy!</i></p>

			<h2>"Sure... but why does this website look like shit?"</h2>
			<p>Hey bud, listen up. I've worked as a front-end designer, and if you want to see what
			I can to do make things pretty, feel free to look at my resume (shameless plug - my
			resume is available to download on this website.) Instead of getting into an argument
			about functionality vs. aesthetic (which I'll probably end up writing about anyways), 
			would like to ask you a series of boolean questions:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Is this website easy to read?</li>
				<li>Is this website responsive?</li>
				<li>Is this website lightweight?</li>
				<li>Does this website require me to spend barely any time to maintain?</li>
			</ul>

			<p>At the end of the day, this is just another <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/" />
				website</a> that everybody can use easily.</p>

			<p>With that being said, I may end up wanting to do some JavaScript experiemnt in the future.
			So, if you see any fancy animations, search functionality, or some wierd ML business, please
			be 100% certain that it is me trying out something new, <i>not</i> me putting aesthetic before
			functionality.</p>
